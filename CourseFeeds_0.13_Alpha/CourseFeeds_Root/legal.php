				small team of undergraduates from University of Michigan-Dearborn looking to create a platform 
				for students and professors alike to share their awesome finds across the web with anyone from 
				any academic institution. We want to tear down the walled gardens of LMS' and MOOCs in a disruptive way.</p>
